2 FILE - CODING PART
In initial step I Import 4 liabraries such as panda as pd for analys and manuplation, matplotlib.pyplot as plt for create the plot, seaborn as sns for visulization, numpy as np for mathematical operations. Thereafter I import my data set name as 'Sales dataset'. Afterthat we check the shape as well as duplicate values and null values in our dataset and also fill null value with 0. Afterthat we check the data summary. Aftherthat we check unique values and also rename some columns. We also check datatyp and convert object into category. Thereafter we do data visulization. Thereafter we balance our target variable. The next stage is modelling section in which we run some models. At last we create confusion matrix.
